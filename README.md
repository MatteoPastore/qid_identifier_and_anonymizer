# qid_identifier_and_anonymizer
It contains a framework to select the best QID by the number of disclosed singletons and it provides an anonymization mechanism (based on generalization and suppression) to anonymize the well-known QID (year_of_birth, sex, sex) by minimizing the number of singletons while minimizing the number of affected rows.
