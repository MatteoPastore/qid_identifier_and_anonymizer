# qid_identifier_and_anonymizer
This repository contains a (software) Anonymization Framework to perform singletons analysis and anonymization of OpenDataâ€™s datasets. OpenData must guarantee consistent information but at the same time must not harm the privacy of individuals. Analyzing open datasets containing information relating to licenses and published by the Italian government, the well-known quasi-identifier (date of birth, sex, municipality of residence) exhibits up to 2% of singleton, i.e. uniquely determined tuples, in already anonymized datasets. Our goal is to find the best tradeoff between consistent information (Fewer modified or deleted tuples) and maintaining privacy (Fewer number of singletons). The Framework select the best QID by the number of disclosed singletons and it provides an anonymization mechanism (based on generalization and suppression) to anonymize the well-known QID (year_of_birth, sex, sex) by minimizing the number of singletons while minimizing the number of affected rows.

It is a diagrammatic representation of the involved actors in the framework and their interactions. The blue boxes represent abstract classes, while the white boxes represent concrete classes.
